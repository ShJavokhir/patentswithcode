This patent describes how a dating or matching app can take basic profile information from users—such as age, location, interests, preferences, and personality traits—and use it to automatically suggest potential matches. The system collects profiles, analyzes user-provided traits, and compares them to others in a large pool. It also allows users to express simple yes/no preferences (like the now-famous swipe left/right) and uses these signals to refine which profiles get shown next.

The system continuously adjusts match recommendations based on user behavior. For example, if you “like” someone, that profile can become a “seed” and the algorithm then looks for people similar to that person. The patent also covers additional data-driven techniques, like identifying shared keywords between profiles, estimating someone’s attractiveness based on how often their profile is viewed or liked, and surfacing “fate-based” coincidences (same hometown, same birthday, etc.) to make matches feel more meaningful.

Finally, the patent explains how mutual interest unlocks communication: both users must express preference for each other before messaging is allowed. It also introduces social features like letting a friend recommend matches on your behalf, and describes how the app ranks users based on compatibility, proximity, and shared traits. Overall, the patent outlines the full logic behind how Tinder recommends, orders, and presents potential matches while minimizing unwanted messages and improving match quality.
